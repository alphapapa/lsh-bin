# Various Minor Scripts

I prefer using tiny scripts to aliases because it saves me going around to all my open terminals and re-sourcing .profile, and I have them available from contexts that aren't my main shell. This is the collection of those scripts that aren't machine-specific.

## The Scripts

### backup

Perform an rsync backup to 192.168.1.254:backup/$HOST (hardcoded, sorry).

Usage: `backup home` or `backup full`

### bringwindow

Use vmenu to choose from a list of existent X clients to switch to, or bring to the current workspace.

Usage: `bringwindow -a` to switch to window, or `bringwindow -R` to bring the window to your current workspace.

### journal

Launch gvim on a new file under `~/writing/journal` with a name generated by the `logdate` command.

### logdate

Output the current time in `YYYYMMDD:HHMM.SS (epoch+UNIXTIME)` format.

### mknote

Use zsh `vared` and `logdate` to append a timestamped line to `~/writing/notes.txt`.

### noteloop

Just runs `mknote` in a loop, for e.g. keeping a drawer term to collect and show notes.

### scut (Super | Simple | Suckless) cut.

An improved version of the POSIX `cut` command.

Usage: `scut FIELDSPEC,[FIELDSPEC[,...]] [-dDELIMITER] [-jJOINER]`

`FIELDSPEC` is either an integer, or a range of the form `n-m`. If it is an integer, that field (zero-based) from each line of `STDIN` will be printed to `STDOUT`. If it is a range, fields `n` (inclusive) through `m` (exclusive) will be printed. `n` also allows the special field separator `^` which causes all fields from the beginning of the line until field `m` to be printed, verbatim, without replacing field separators with field joiners. Similarly, `m` supports the special value `$` which prints from field `n` through the end of the line, verbatim.

`DELIMITER` is any regex supported by the Pyton 2 regex module and is used to split input lines into fields.
`JOINER` is the string used to join fields together in the output. Escape sequences such as '\t' will be processed into their represented characters.

Unlike the `cut` command, fields specified multiple times will be printed multiple times.

### shistory

Use `vmenu` to select a line from `STDIN` (assumed to be output from the `history` command) and print it to `STDOUT`. Intended to be used from your shell's `readline` to place a selection from your history on the command line for editing.

### tman

Run `man` with the given arguments, and display the outputs in a new terminal window.

### vmenu

Run `dmenu` in vertical format, with multi-token matching, and the given arguments.

### www-browser

Invoke `$BROWSER` with the given arguments.
